# 424. Longest Repeating Character Replacement

# You are given a string s and an integer k. You can choose any character of the 
# string and change it to any other uppercase English character. 
# You can perform this operation at most k times.

# Return the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can get 
# after performing the above operations.

# Example 1:
# Input: s = "ABAB", k = 2
# Output: 4
# Explanation: Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa.
# Example 2:
# Input: s = "AABABBA", k = 1
# Output: 4
# Explanation: Replace the one 'A' in the middle with 'B' and form "AABBBBA".
# The substring "BBBB" has the longest repeating letters, which is 4.
# There may exists other ways to achieve this answer too.
# A   A: 1  R-L+1 - max (count) = 1 > 1
# AA  A: 2 =1-0+1 - 1 = 1 > 1
# AAB A: 2 B:1  = 2-0+1 - 2 = 1 >1
# AABA A: 3 B: 1 = 3-0+1 - 3 =1 >1
# AABAB A:3 B:2  = 4-0+1 - 3 = 2 > 1 SHIFT LEFT
